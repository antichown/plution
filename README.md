# plution
Prototype pollution scanner using headless chrome


# What this is
Plution is a convenient way to scan at scale for pages that are vulnerable to prototype pollution via a URL payload. In its default configuration, it will use a hardcoded payload that can detect 11 of the cases documented here: https://github.com/BlackFan/client-side-prototype-pollution/tree/master/pp
